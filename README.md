20.5 years old at the time of January 2024. Bisexual, retired professional dumbass (found someone stupider). Timezone I live in is CST.
Avid video game collector and preservation enthusiast. Nintendo fan. Freelance logo editor, pixel artist, regular artist too.
Some of my history involves Adventure for the Atari 2600, Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS, and Furret from Pokémon Black and White.
I have vague C++ and Java coding knowledge, but coding is *not* my main route. Probably because I am way better at drawing than coding.
Most if not all social media contacts should use the same username, capitalized or not.
..who the hell bothers to use emojis in a coding environment?
